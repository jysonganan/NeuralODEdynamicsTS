# NeuralODE_dynamics_TimeSeries


Generalize the discete form models such as RNN and GRU to continuous form. 
Solving ODE (dynamical system) to obtain the continuous hidden dynamics of neural networks models is the main direction of this repository. 
The applications of NeuralODE models in the time series modeling problems.
